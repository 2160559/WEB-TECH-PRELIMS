                Barangay San Vicente was once a pasture land utilized by the Ibalois and was once part of Barangay Poliwes. On the year 1962, the inhabitants of the area decided to separate a part of Poliwes barangay into a new barangay in order to benefit independently from the programs of the government. During that time, the government was distributing an amount of P2,000.00 to each barangay for developmental purposes and the community folks were interested of the fund, which is actually the main logic that initiates the plan. In relation to the separation, RA 3595, PD 86-A, PD 86-B, 210 and 557 legally supported the proceedings that paved the way for the creation of Barangay San Vicente.

                The name of the barangay was derived from Mr. Vicente who has led a group of people to find a place to dwell in permanently and peacefully and he found it in the locality.
                Sometimes in the Mid 50’s, Vicente Aliweng from Tanulong Sagada, Mt. Province came to this place and works as a gardener at Camp 7 Barangay. He then ask a caretaker of this land if he could be allowed to build a temporary shelter were he could stay after work, which was favorably given to him by the caretaker, he then built a shelter where the house of Mrs. Dumagos now stands at present.
                Mateo Bayoya, a native of Besao Mt. Province, lived at that time somewhere at Slaughter House Compound, he was disallowed and was ordered to vacate the land where he built his house hor some reason. He then happened to come to this place and saw the vast land uninhabited.
                In his visit to this place, he went to see Vicente, and he invited him at his residence at Slaughter House, with other purpose to arrange marriage with his niece. Vicente did not object to the proposal, he was in love at first sight with Bayoya’s niece and they got married. 
                In 1958, Bayoya took what is left of his demolished house to this place and built it whereat present is still standing. Dialogues and negotiations between the claimant of the land (Balong Clase) and Bayoya proceeded.
                Barangay Captain of Poliwes, Mr. Kis-ing, together with Bayoya resumed negotiations with Mr. Calse regarding the alleged illegal settling in his land, took this case to the city and favour is slightly with Bayoya.

                Improvement of this place was very fat, roads and other infrastructures were constructed. Few months later, other followed Bayoa, mostly they came from Mt. Province who tried their luck of finding fortune in the Cit. Mr. Paulino Medina is one. Bayoya agreed that Medina will occupt the Upper portion of the place. He then started introducing improvements there to, identifying where infrastructure be constructed.
                A man of Ilocano roots, Dionisio Esmabe Sr. was allowed and was given portion below where Medina has settled. Other who heard this fortune followed and were allotted a place where the could built ehir shelter.
                In 1960, the government was extending an amount of two thousand (P 2,000.00)  pesos to each barangay for development purposes, this prompts the folks to ask from the city government for a separatios and creation of an independent barangay. Finally, 1962, under RA 3595, PD 86-A, 86-B and 557 San Vicente Barangay was legally and formally created nominate after Vicente, the first settler of this place from the mountain Province., the title Saint was added to show folks are of religious origin. Th School, Quezon Primary School, was changed to San Vicente Elemetar School. Othe institution followed and carried the name San Vicente.
                Bayoya was then appointed as the first arrio captain of this new Barangay.

            <h1>WHAT IS CULTURE?</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
               As part of a group of people or nation we are responsible to learn our culture. No matter where you are, even if you don’t know these people you need to learn their culture to establish a better communication to them.
            </p>
            
            <P>
                Culture is known by arts, rituals, materials and things used for living and all that is considered to be sacred in their belief. Culture has been known throughout the world and many kinds of culture are still alive, preserved and some is used for tourist attraction. Culture of is can be easily acquire. For example we can acquire another culture by moving to different place or country. We are responsible to learn their culture to show them respect that can establish a good relationship.
            </P>
            
            <p>
                Most of us acquire our culture knowledge by learning, shared by other people, passed by parents to their children and sometimes adapting it to other people that just visiting where we are. Today culture can be share in many ways, but the one that we see the most effective is social media. A lot of people have a social media account like Facebook, Twitter and some blog websites like Word Press and almost all of people around the world have access to the internet, we know that sharing information today is just simply a click of button. So this is easy way for us to pass and preserve our culture for future generation.

            <h1>WHY IS CULTURE IMPORTANT?</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                As we discussed earlier that when we are in another country, we are responsible to learn their culture to for a better communication and good relationship. This is one of the reason why culture is important to us because it is like the way of us to become closer. It help us to understand not just a group of people but also country, this can establish a good relationship country to country. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Culture take vital role to our society. Without it maybe society will be impossible to us and the worst is it will not exist. Culture is like our root, like Marcus Garvey said in his quotation “A people without the knowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots”. So we further understand this beautiful quotation a tree without a root will not grow and later on it will be dead. That tree is also like our culture, without this culture we will not exist or we will live without our identity. Culture can provide us solutions to problem that our community or country currently facing. Preserving culture help us to think just for ourselves but we will tend to think other people that belong to our community, nation or country.
