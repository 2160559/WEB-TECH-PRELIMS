                Barangay San Vicente was once a pasture land utilized by the Ibalois and was once part of Barangay Poliwes. On the year 1962, the inhabitants of the area decided to separate a part of Poliwes barangay into a new barangay in order to benefit independently from the programs of the government. During that time, the government was distributing an amount of P2,000.00 to each barangay for developmental purposes and the community folks were interested of the fund, which is actually the main logic that initiates the plan. In relation to the separation, RA 3595, PD 86-A, PD 86-B, 210 and 557 legally supported the proceedings that paved the way for the creation of Barangay San Vicente.

                The name of the barangay was derived from Mr. Vicente who has led a group of people to find a place to dwell in permanently and peacefully and he found it in the locality.
                Sometimes in the Mid 50’s, Vicente Aliweng from Tanulong Sagada, Mt. Province came to this place and works as a gardener at Camp 7 Barangay. He then ask a caretaker of this land if he could be allowed to build a temporary shelter were he could stay after work, which was favorably given to him by the caretaker, he then built a shelter where the house of Mrs. Dumagos now stands at present.
                Mateo Bayoya, a native of Besao Mt. Province, lived at that time somewhere at Slaughter House Compound, he was disallowed and was ordered to vacate the land where he built his house hor some reason. He then happened to come to this place and saw the vast land uninhabited.
                In his visit to this place, he went to see Vicente, and he invited him at his residence at Slaughter House, with other purpose to arrange marriage with his niece. Vicente did not object to the proposal, he was in love at first sight with Bayoya’s niece and they got married. 
                In 1958, Bayoya took what is left of his demolished house to this place and built it whereat present is still standing. Dialogues and negotiations between the claimant of the land (Balong Clase) and Bayoya proceeded.
                Barangay Captain of Poliwes, Mr. Kis-ing, together with Bayoya resumed negotiations with Mr. Calse regarding the alleged illegal settling in his land, took this case to the city and favour is slightly with Bayoya.
