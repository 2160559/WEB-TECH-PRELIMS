        <h2 class="articleHeadline">Non Compliance of Residents in Waste Segregation</h2>
        <p>
            On January 26, 2001, a consolidated bill was signed into law, by the former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, which is now known as the  Republic Act 9003 or the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000 (Sapuay, 2014). 
        </p>
        <p>
            This Act declares the State to adopt an Ecological Solid Waste Management program and that this program is to be enforced by Local Government Units (LGUâ€™s) as part of their responsibilities.

        </p>
        <p>  
            San Vicente, which is a part of the LGU, formed a committee for solid waste management and this is the Barangay Ecological Solid Waste Management Committee (BESWMC). 
        </p>
        <p>
            One function of this Committee is to segregate and collect solid wastes however, to segregate the wastes is not supposed to be a function of the barangay officials but the responsibility of each household. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Waste segregation is expected as a general practice however because of the lack of discipline, initiative to help , indifference and for whatever reason, this is not followed. The effect of this is that part of the time and effort of barangay officials are directed to waste segregation instead of a more valuable function like conducting seminars or training for composting to barangay residents.
